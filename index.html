                a guru or preceptor after initiation.[35] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship 
                between the Guru and his Shishya (students /disciples) was a very important part of education.[36] Takshasila

                in 1976, education fell under the concurrent list.[8] This allowed the central government to recommend
